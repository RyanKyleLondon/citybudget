London Ontario's City Budget API

== Development Setup ==

Clone the project to a web-accessible folder.

	git clone git://github.com/rtraction/citybudget.git citybudgetapi

Copy application/config/config.sample.php to application/config/config.php.
Edit application/config/config.php and put your URL into $config['base_url'].

Copy application/config/database.sample.php to application/config/database.php.
Configure your database settings in application/config/database.php.

Note: If you are going into a production environment you should not make 
application/controllers/import.php publicly available.

Run citybudget.sql into your database.

That's it! Test your setup by navigating to the site, for example:

	http://localhost/citybudgetapi/api/organizations/


Most important files are in
	application/controllers/
	application/models/
	application/views/

== What is this project? ==

The budget data for London is currently available on the city website in PDF form. 

This is not a very useful format for creating visualizations and applications.

This project takes the city budget, that has been manually entered into a spreadsheet by volunteers, and imports it into a database. Now the data can be accessed programmatically and displayed with this API.

Check it out in action at http://budget.opendatalondon.com/ 

We're hoping to have some cool apps implementing this software by the end of Open Data Hackathon Day :)
